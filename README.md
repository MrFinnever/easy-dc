# Easy DC

Easy DC is a Kotlin and Java-based Android application that calculates the currents in each branch of a DC electrical circuit. The app allows users to input parameters such as resistances and EMF values for multiple branches and automatically computes the resulting branch currents.

This project was created by students of the College of Electronics and Instrumentation (Saint-Petersburg, Russia) for the "Youth and Technology 2024" competition. The goal of the project is to simplify working with DC electrical circuits. The project helps students and everyone involved in electronics to easily and accessibly calculate currents for any DC circuit configuration.

In addition to the calculator, the project includes an extensive guide on DC electrical circuits, emphasizing the project's accessibility for every student. The authors of the project hope that it will help future electronics specialists in their learning and make their lives easier.
